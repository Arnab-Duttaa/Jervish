Hi, I have created this project by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some commands are inserted before and if the user says those commands, it will act accordingly.
But before doing anything you have to provide your very basic details. Those information will be stored in your localstorage. It can also show batteryhealth, Wifi connectivity and weather report after filling the form.
